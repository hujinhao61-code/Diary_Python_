I'm back in the Monday, I've not upgrade my code in 1101 Saturday.

I was just using "class" and "__main__" in python for the first time, I will share 2rd part of my code continuously, hope for you watching.

Key words:

    self.connection = pymysql.connect(**self.config)

    with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:

        cursor.execute("SELECT kg_id, kg_code FROM xj_kg_space_info_tb WHERE kg_name = %s", (kg_name,))
    
        kg_query_result = cursor.fetchall()  # kg query resutl
    
(I will add the "Key words" part for my memory in learning python, wwwwww)

The code in 3rd day was definitely easiest part. Maybe tomorrow we can finish the test python.

Key words:

    for i, kg_result in enumerate(kg_results, start=1):
    
    result_dict["total_time"] = round(time.time() - total_start_time, 3)

Thanks for watching~
